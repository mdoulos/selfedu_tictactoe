# Self Education Repository

This project followed the React tutorial put on by Hunor Borb√©ly at https://www.skillshare.com/en/classes/Tic-Tac-Toe-A-Playful-Intro-to-React/

Notably this app was built differently than in the tutorial. The tutorial has students build directly in CodePen, but I wanted to challenge myself to be able to adapt the instructions into a different development environment.

This repository is a part of a series in which I am teaching myself React and other technologies by watching tutorials.
